# Predictive Modeling with Global Health Data

## Description:

In this project, we worked with a large, integrated dataset containing global health indicators like life expectancy, mortality rates, and GDP. The goal was to predict life expectancy using various regression models. We divided the dataset into training and test sets and used k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression and logistic regression to make predictions. We assessed the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as R-squared and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This project aimed to understand how global health factors could predict outcomes and demonstrated the challenges of working with real-world datasets.

## Techniques & Tools:

- Data Integration: Combining diverse global health data sources

- Modeling: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression, Logistic regression

- Evaluation: R-squared, RMSE

- Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Microsoft Excel (csv and xlsx)

## Contributions: 

This was a project done for university work. The parts being included here are all the individual contirbutions extracted from the groupwork.
- Data Processing: integrating the 4 different datasets into one, done by me.
- Data Visualisation: creating graphs and charts to represent information from the datasets, part of group contribution.
- Machine Learning & Results Report: using machine learning to predict information, extracting information, and testing the accuracy from results. The report is part of the group work, but the code and cleaned dataset included in this repository are all done by me.

The parts included in this repository are all the contributions I did for the project, so the parts included are mostly my work, along with contributions in the final stage by Andy Chen.
